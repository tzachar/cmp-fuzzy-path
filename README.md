# cmp-fuzzy-path

`nvim-cmp` source for filesystem paths, employing `fd` and regular expressions to
find files.

Depends on [fuzzy.nvim](https://github.com/tzachar/fuzzy.nvim) (which depends
either on `fzf` or on `fzy`).

To facilitate fuzzy matching, when `cmp-fuzzy-path` tries to find a path the
path is first transformed to a regular expression like this: `p/t/f` -->
`p.*/.*t.*/.*f.'`, which will match `path/to/file` and also
`pa/toooo/other_file`.

To prevent excessive invocations of this plugin, the completion will only be
triggered when the string currently being entered matches a path regular
expression. To quickly trigger completions, make sure to either use a leading `/`
or a leading './'

In spcecial cases, while in command mode, the plugin will be invoked regardless
to facilitate faster file searching. This behaviour is implemented only when the
first character of the command is in `{'e', 'w'}`.

# Installation

Using [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/) with `fzf`:
```lua
use {'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim', run = 'make'}
use "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp"
use {'tzachar/cmp-fuzzy-path', requires = {'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp', 'tzachar/fuzzy.nvim'}}
```

Using [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/) with `fzy`:
```lua
use {'romgrk/fzy-lua-native', run = 'make'}
use "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp"
use {'tzachar/cmp-fuzzy-path', requires = {'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp', 'tzachar/fuzzy.nvim'}}
```

You should have `fd` in your `PATH`, or edit the configuation to point at the
exact location.


# Setup

```lua
require'cmp'.setup {
  sources = cmp.config.sources({
    { name = 'fuzzy_path'},
  })
}
```

This plugin can also be used to complete file names for `:edit` or `:write` in cmdline mode of cmp:
```lua
cmp.setup.cmdline(':', {
  sources = cmp.config.sources({
    { name = 'fuzzy_path' }
  })
})
```

*Note:* the plugin's name is `fuzzy_path` in `cmp`'s config.


# Configuration

Configuration can be passed when configuring `cmp`:

```lua
cmp.setup.cmdline(':', {
  sources = cmp.config.sources({
    { name = 'fuzzy_path', option = {fd_timeout_msec = 1500} }
  })
})
```

## fd_timeout_msec (type: int)

_Default:_ 500

How much grace to give the file finder before killing it. If you set this to too
short a value, you will probably not get enough suggestions.

## fd_cmd (type: table(string))

_Default:_ `{'fd', '-d', '20', '-p'}`

The commend to use as a file finder. Note that `-p` is needed so we match on the
entire path, not just on the file or directory name.

Please note that, by default, `fd` returns only files. If you want directories,
you need to add `-t d -t f` to `fd_cmd` table.

## cmd_trigger_regex (type: string)

_Default:_ `[[^\%(e\|w\)\s\+]]`

The regular expression to use to trigger the plugin when in command mode.

## path_regex (type: string)

_Default:_ `[[^\%(\k\?[/:\~]\+\|\.\?\.\/\)\S\+]]`

The regular expression to use to match paths.

# Sorting

`cmp-fuzzy-path` adds a score entry to each completion item's `data` field,
which can be used to override `cmp`'s default sorting order:


```lua
local compare = require('cmp.config.compare')
cmp.setup({
  sorting = {
    priority_weight = 2,
    comparators = {
      require('cmp_fuzzy_path.compare'),
      compare.offset,
      compare.exact,
      compare.score,
      compare.recently_used,
      compare.kind,
      compare.sort_text,
      compare.length,
      compare.order,
    },
  },
}
```

# Commands

`cmp-fuzzy-path` add the following commands:

## `CmpFuzzyStats`

`CmpFuzzyStats` can be used to gather statistics about the operation of the
plugin. Output contains the following: 

- Total Usage Count: how many times the plugin was called
- Timeout Count: how many times we reached a timeout
- Average Search Time: the average time it took to complete the search
